2)when N=16, V1 time=600.
3)router time=800
4) talk with zhiyuan yao, in weekend

1) pageRank. when N=4,5. Converage, when N>5, overflow

12/06/2015 10:49 AM
1) pageRank is not overflow. The adj proven to be wrong. adj can't be random array. 

get same converaged result as pagerank_sample.v

try to reduce multi to reduce time.
 > multi_module? no, too slow
 >dirty bit, reduce unnecessary multi? no, time incrasing. depend on the largest datapath
> combine db*weight? no much diference.

tested N=8, get 16384, 1228.

vals converaged, but sort result is wrong
converaged values seems wrong

12/11/2015  12:03 AM
----------------------
vals loses output

12/12/2015  11:59 PM
----------------------
1)vals updatas, but not converage
possible issue: 
1) vals not synchronized >> add syc signal? (X)
synchronized. but still not converage.
possible issue: 
2) change to v1 page update. use next_val, cur_val
3) Width too small
